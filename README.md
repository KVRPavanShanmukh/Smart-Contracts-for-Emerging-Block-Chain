# Smart-Contracts-for-Emerging-Block-Chain
This repository completely consists of our teamwork and development of our project.
# 🚀 Full Stack Smart Contracts Application (Blockchain)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **full-stack decentralized application (DApp)** focused on **building, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts using blockchain technology**.  
The project demonstrates how modern web applications can seamlessly integrate with blockchain networks to provide **secure, transparent, and trustless systems**.

Our goal is to design an end-to-end solution that connects:
- Smart Contracts (Blockchain Layer)
- Backend Services
- Frontend User Interface
- Wallet Integrations
